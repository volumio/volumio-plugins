# Microsoft Graph TypeScript Types
The Microsoft Graph TypeScript definitions enable editors to provide intellisense on Microsoft Graph objects including users, messages, and groups.

## Installation

We recommend including the .d.ts file by downloading this package through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```bash

# Install types and save in package.json as a development dependency
npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-types --save-dev

```

## Examples
The following examples assume that you have a valid access token. We used [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) to perform the HTTP requests, but you can use [our JavaScript client library](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) or other libraries as well.
```typescript
import * as MicrosoftGraph from "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types"

import * as request from 'superagent';
const accessToken:string = "";
```
### List my recent messages
```typescript
request
    .get("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages")
    .set('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + accessToken)
    .end((err, res) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error(err)
            return;
        }
        let messages:[MicrosoftGraph.Message] = res.body.value;
        for (let msg of messages) { //iterate through the recent messages
            console.log(msg.subject);
            console.log(msg.toRecipients[0].emailAddress.address);
        }

    })
```
### Send an email as the logged in user
```typescript
// Create the message object

// Note that all the properties must follow the interface definitions.
// For example, this will not compile if you try to type "xml" instead of "html" for contentType. 

let mail:MicrosoftGraph.Message = {
    subject: "Microsoft Graph TypeScript Sample",
    toRecipients: [{
        emailAddress: {
            address: "microsoftgraph@example.com"
        }
    }],
    body: {
        content: "<h1>Microsoft Graph TypeScript Sample</h1>Try modifying the sample",
        contentType: "html"
    }
}
// send the email by sending a POST request to the Microsoft Graph
request
    .post('https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/me/sendMail')
    .send({message: mail})
    .set('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + accessToken)
    .end((err, res) => {
        console.log(res)
    })

```
## Microsoft Graph beta support
If you want to test the Microsoft Graph beta endpoints, you can use those types simultaneously with the v1.0 types.

Update your package.json file with the following:

```javascript
  "devDependencies": {
    // import published v1.0 types with a version from NPM
    "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types": "^0.4.0",

    // import beta types from the beta branch on the GitHub repo
    "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types-beta": "microsoftgraph/msgraph-typescript-typings#beta"
  }
}
```

Import the beta types from `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types-beta`
```typescript
// import individual entities
import {User as BetaUser} from "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types-beta"

// or import everything under MicrosoftGraphBeta
import * as MicrosoftGraphBeta from "@microsoft/microsoft-graph-types-beta"
```

## Supported editors
Any TypeScript project can consume these types when using at least TypeScript 2.0.  We've tested including the types as a dependency in the following editors.
* Visual Studio Code
* WebStorm
* Atom with the [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) plugin
