# Jellyfin plugin for Volumio

Volumio plugin for playing audio from one or more [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) servers. It has been tested on Volumio 2.834 + Jellyfin 10.6.4.

#### Adding a Jellyfin Server

You can add a Jellyfin server in the ```Add a Server``` section of the plugin settings. The server can be on the same network as your Volumio device, or it can be remote (of course, you would have to configure the server so that it is accessible from the Internet). 


*Make sure you provide the full server address. "http://www.myjellyfinserver.com:8096" would be a valid example, but leaving out the "http://" will render it invalid.*

You can add multiple servers, and those that are reachable will appear when you click ```Jellyfin``` in the left menu. Choose a server to login and start browsing your music collections. Enjoy!

#### Notes

- Audio is served through Direct Streaming. This means when you play a song, it will be streamed to Volumio in its original format without any modifications. This gives you the highest sound quality possible but, if you are streaming from a remote server, then you should consider whether you have a fast-enough Internet connection with unlimited data.
- (PR submitted and accepted. Will make note of this when this fix appears in next version of Volumio) If the URI of an audio stream contains the letters 'bbc', Volumio will fail to update the stream's playback status and the queue will stop after playing the current stream. This is because the MPD plugin that is supplied with Volumio, and which the Jellyfin plugin utilizes, assumes URIs containing 'bbc' has got to be BBC webradio streams and tries to parse the stream's information in a particular way that would cause it to fail with the Jellyfin streams. ~~A workaround may be possible but not provided since this behavior is caused by a reckless assumption that should be fixed within the MPD plugin.~~ Until Volumio pushes a fix, you can run a script provided by the Jellyfin plugin to resolve this. To run the script, SSH into Volumio and then:

```
volumio:~$ /data/plugins/music_service/jellyfin/scripts/fix_mpd_bbc
```
Enter 'y' when prompted for confirmation:
```
This script will modify /volumio/app/plugins/music_service/mpd/index.js as follows:

Search:
if (objTrackInfo.file.indexOf('bbc') >= 0) {

Replace with:
if (objTrackInfo.file.indexOf('bbc') >= 0 && objTrackInfo.Name) {

Proceed [Y/n]? y

Operation completed.

You need to restart Volumio for changes to be applied. Would you like to do that now [Y/n]? y

Volumio restarted
```
