metrics are equal to zero. The default is false which will exclude these
rows.
* @property {analyticsreporting(v4).MetricFilterClause[]} metricFilterClauses The metric filter clauses. They are logically combined with the `AND`
operator.  Metric filters look at only the first date range and not the
comparing date range. Note that filtering on metrics occurs after the
metrics are aggregated.
* @property {integer} pageSize Page size is for paging and specifies the maximum number of returned rows.
Page size should be &gt;= 0. A query returns the default of 1,000 rows.
The Analytics Core Reporting API returns a maximum of 10,000 rows per
request, no matter how many you ask for. It can also return fewer rows
than requested, if there aren&#39;t as many dimension segments as you expect.
For instance, there are fewer than 300 possible values for `ga:country`,
so when segmenting only by country, you can&#39;t get more than 300 rows,
even if you set `pageSize` to a higher value.
* @property {boolean} hideTotals If set to true, hides the total of all metrics for all the matching rows,
for every date range. The default false and will return the totals.
* @property {boolean} hideValueRanges If set to true, hides the minimum and maximum across all matching rows.
The default is false and the value ranges are returned.

in the request the `ga:cohort` dimension must be present.
Every [ReportRequest](#ReportRequest) within a `batchGet` method must
contain the same `cohortGroup` definition.
* @property {string} filtersExpression Dimension or metric filters that restrict the data returned for your
request. To use the `filtersExpression`, supply a dimension or metric on
which to filter, followed by the filter expression. For example, the
following expression selects `ga:browser` dimension which starts with
Firefox; `ga:browser=~^Firefox`. For more information on dimensions
and metric filters, see
[Filters reference](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/reference#filters).
* @property {string} viewId The Analytics
[view ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009618)
from which to retrieve data. Every [ReportRequest](#ReportRequest)
within a `batchGet` method must contain the same `viewId`.
* @property {analyticsreporting(v4).Metric[]} metrics The metrics requested.
Requests must specify at least one metric. Requests can have a
total of 10 metrics.
* @property {analyticsreporting(v4).DimensionFilterClause[]} dimensionFilterClauses The dimension filter clauses for filtering Dimension Values. They are
logically combined with the `AND` operator. Note that filtering occurs
before any dimensions are aggregated, so that the returned metrics
represent the total for only the relevant dimensions.
* @property {analyticsreporting(v4).OrderBy[]} orderBys Sort order on output rows. To compare two rows, the elements of the
following are applied in order until a difference is found.  All date
ranges in the output get the same row order.
* @property {analyticsreporting(v4).Segment[]} segments Segment the data returned for the request. A segment definition helps look
at a subset of the segment request. A request can contain up to four
segments. Every [ReportRequest](#ReportRequest) within a
`batchGet` method must contain the same `segments` definition. Requests
with segments must have the `ga:segment` dimension.
* @property {string} samplingLevel The desired report
[sample](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192) size.
If the the `samplingLevel` field is unspecified the `DEFAULT` sampling
level is used. Every [ReportRequest](#ReportRequest) within a
`batchGet` method must contain the same `samplingLevel` definition. See
[developer guide](/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/basics#sampling)
 for details.
* @property {analyticsreporting(v4).Dimension[]} dimensions The dimensions requested.
Requests can have a total of 7 dimensions.
* @property {analyticsreporting(v4).DateRange[]} dateRanges Date ranges in the request. The request can have a maximum of 2 date
ranges. The response will contain a set of metric values for each
combination of the dimensions for each date range in the request. So, if
there are two date ranges, there will be two set of metric values, one for
the original date range and one for the second date range.
The `reportRequest.dateRanges` field should not be specified for cohorts
or Lifetime value requests.
If a date range is not provided, the default date range is (startDate:
current date - 7 days, endDate: current date - 1 day). Every
[ReportRequest](#ReportRequest) within a `batchGet` method must
contain the same `dateRanges` definition.
* @property {string} pageToken A continuation token to get the next page of the results. Adding this to
the request will return the rows after the pageToken. The pageToken should
be the value returned in the nextPageToken parameter in the response to
the GetReports request.

/**
 * @typedef Dimension
 * @memberOf! analyticsreporting(v4)
 * @type object
* @property {string[]} histogramBuckets If non-empty, we place dimension values into buckets after string to
int64. Dimension values that are not the string representation of an
integral value will be converted to zero.  The bucket values have to be in
increasing order.  Each bucket is closed on the lower end, and open on the
upper end. The &quot;first&quot; bucket includes all values less than the first
boundary, the &quot;last&quot; bucket includes all values up to infinity. Dimension
values that fall in a bucket get transformed to a new dimension value. For
example, if one gives a list of &quot;0, 1, 3, 4, 7&quot;, then we return the
following buckets:

- bucket #1: values &lt; 0, dimension value &quot;&lt;0&quot;
- bucket #2: values in [0,1), dimension value &quot;0&quot;
- bucket #3: values in [1,3), dimension value &quot;1-2&quot;
- bucket #4: values in [3,4), dimension value &quot;3&quot;
- bucket #5: values in [4,7), dimension value &quot;4-6&quot;
- bucket #6: values &gt;= 7, dimension value &quot;7+&quot;

NOTE: If you are applying histogram mutation on any dimension, and using
that dimension in sort, you will want to use the sort type
`HISTOGRAM_BUCKET` for that purpose. Without that the dimension values
will be sorted according to dictionary
(lexicographic) order. For example the ascending dictionary order is:

   &quot;&lt;50&quot;, &quot;1001+&quot;, &quot;121-1000&quot;, &quot;50-120&quot;

And the ascending `HISTOGRAM_BUCKET` order is:

   &quot;&lt;50&quot;, &quot;50-120&quot;, &quot;121-1000&quot;, &quot;1001+&quot;

The client has to explicitly request `&quot;orderType&quot;: &quot;HISTOGRAM_BUCKET&quot;`
for a histogram-mutated dimension.

If the value of lifetimeValue is false:

- The metric values are similar to the values in the web interface cohort
  report.
- The cohort definition date ranges must be aligned to the calendar week
  and month. i.e. while requesting `ga:cohortNthWeek` the `startDate` in
  the cohort definition should be a Sunday and the `endDate` should be the
  following Saturday, and for `ga:cohortNthMonth`, the `startDate`
  should be the 1st of the month and `endDate` should be the last day

When the lifetimeValue is true:

- The metric values will correspond to the values in the web interface
  LifeTime value report.
- The Lifetime Value report shows you how user value (Revenue) and
  engagement (Appviews, Goal Completions, Sessions, and Session Duration)
  grow during the 90 days after a user is acquired.
- The metrics are calculated as a cumulative average per user per the time
