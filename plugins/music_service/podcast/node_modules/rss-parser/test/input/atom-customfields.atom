*We screwed up the calculation of Jack Dorsey's shares based on different classes of stock. The correct percentage is closer to 18%. We apologize for the error and will be more diligent in the future.

Winner: Square. After a rocky start, the payment company rebounds under Dorsey's leadership.

Loser: TV networks continue their descent with fewer 30-second spots and still-unresolved attribution challenges.

Winner: Consumers, who already benefit from AI while tech moguls philosophically debate its future.

   <media:description>Winner: Walmart, which has taken a page from Amazon's playbook and stepped up its storytelling. 

Winner: Giphy, the four-year-old GIF search engine with more daily users than Snapchat. 

Plus everything that happens in an Internet minute.

*We screwed up on the YouTube stat and compared hours viewed to videos watched. Our apologies.

   <media:description>The pace of store closures is accelerating. In 2017, retailers are on track to close more stores than in 2015 and 2016 combined. However, our research suggests that brands investing in improving digital performance see offline benefits -- including protection from Amazon.

L2’s seventh annual Digital IQ Index: Specialty Retail analyzes the digital competence of 102 brands operating in the U.S. For more insights, visit L2inc.com.</media:description>

   <media:description>With digital sales of food and beverages expected to eclipse 20 percent by 2025, the food industry is ripe for disruption.

While only ten percent of brands offer direct-to-consumer e-commerce on-site, there is near-universal distribution across major e-tailers. However, those sites present an increasing challenge as private label brands evolve into formidable competition. With the Amazon acquisition of Whole Foods, food brands face a disruptor whose private labels dominate the site’s food categories, coupled with technology that could be the Lucifer of brand equity: Alexa.

L2's fourth Digital IQ Index: Food 2017 benchmarks the digital performance of 146 brands. For more insights, visit http://bit.ly/2vqxsGS.</media:description>

   <media:description>Loser: Unsustainable internet companies. Pureplays like Wayfair and Blue Apron are getting Amazon-like valuations without a critical component: a business that works.

Loser: The brand-industrial complex. Startup Brandless sells generic household items for $3 each, pointing to a larger shift in consumer behavior.

Loser: The smartphone generation. Three-quarters of American teens own iPhones, and the devices are making them more lonely -- but also less likely to do drugs.

   <media:description>For economies to thrive, companies need to hand over a quarter of their profits.

But the Four Horsemen - Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook -- pay far less than the average US corporate tax rate. 

Loser: future generations, who will have to pay off the debt racked up by politicians unwilling to tax the most profitable companies in the world.

   <media:description>Worth more than $2.3 trillion combined, the Big Four (Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google) continue to grab share from media companies, brands, and retailers.

   <media:description>While traditional business valuations have treated cash flow as the ultimate metric for gauging success, many of today's companies focus more on the size of their user community than their bottom line. Responding to evolving perspectives, newer valuation models attempt to assign value to individual consumers, but these models involve a series of assumptions and generalizations that do not always withstand scrutiny. Using Uber as a case study, this session will compare and contrast user-based valuation models with more traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) models, identifying where they converge and diverge.

   <media:description>In recent years, there has been a palpable shift in the nature of the US economy. Corporations are getting bigger at an unprecedented rate. The share of US corporate income earned by the 100 largest firms is at a staggering 85 percent. Facebook has 77 percent of mobile social traffic, Amazon controls 45 percent of US e-commerce, and Google has an 88 percent market share in search advertising. We can connect the shift in the business landscape to the observation that Americans today are highly divided economically, socially, and philosophically.

The L2 Digital Leadership Academy, led by faculty from NYU Stern, Kellogg School of Management, Harvard Business School, and L2 researchers, is a two-day conference rooted in business fundamentals coupled with tactical sessions on digital topics.

Sonia Marciano has been a Clinical Professor at the Stern School of Management since July, 2007.  She is currently the Stern academic director for TRIUM – a joint executive MBA program that includes Stern, LSE and HEC.  Prior to Stern, she was at the Columbia Business School and prior to Columbia, she spent 2.5 years at Harvard’s Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness (ISC), where she developed content for the Institute’s Microeconomics of Competitiveness course which she co-taught with Professor Michael E. Porter.
Before HBS, Professor Marciano spent eight years as a Clinical Professor of Management and Strategy at the Kellogg School of Management, while also lecturing at the University of Chicago.  She has also taught in both executive and full time programs for the Wharton School and Yale SOM.  Currently, Sonia teaches core strategy as well as electives in advanced strategy and global competition.  In addition, she teaches strategy and economics for corporate executive education programs in the U.S., Canada and Europe.
Sonia has won several teaching awards for distinction in teaching, most recently for best professor Yale’s, Kellogg’s as well as in Stern’s Executive MBA programs in 2010, 2011 and 2012. She was among the highest rated management professors at Stern, Columbia, Harvard, Kellogg and the University of Chicago.
She received her BA with honors from the University of Chicago. She worked in consulting, banking and the insurance industries before returning to the University of Chicago to receive her MBA in 1994, and her PhD in Business Economics and Industrial Organization in 2000.</media:description>
