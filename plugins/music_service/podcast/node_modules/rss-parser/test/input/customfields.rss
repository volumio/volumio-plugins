While at one time every parent wanted their children to become engineers, doctors, chartered accountants or MBAs, we now have many parents encouraging their children pursue their passions.</p>

<p>If you’re one of those adventure seeking souls who does not wish to stick to a cubicle every day from 9 to 5 then you might find the following 7 career options satisfying. </p>

<p></p>

<p><span style="color:#B22222;"><strong>1. Bachelor of Rural Studies</strong></span></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://7millioninterns.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/wolfe1031-post.jpg?w=580&amp;h=283" style="width: 600px; height: 293px;" /></p>

<p>If your heart lies in Indian villages and you want to do much more than just go as a tourist and click pictures, this course is for you. The course gives you an opportunity to engage in various rural and community development activities. It covers topics like animal husbandry, forestry, farm management, child development, agriculture, environment management, community development etc.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://www.exuberantsolutions.com/course_logo/ethical-hacking.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 337px;" /></p>

<p>For all those who hack friends’ social networking accounts for “fun”, are good at cracking passwords, unlocking a locked system and spend a majority of their time experimenting with various codes – this is a great way to put those grey cells to a good use. You can breach the security of computer systems and get paid for it!</p>

<p>Photography once regarded just as a hobby has today changed into a high-end lucrative profession.

Movies, television, events-photography plays an important part in every important field today!</p>
