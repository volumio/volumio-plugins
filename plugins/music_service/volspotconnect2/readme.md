#	VOLUMIO SPOTIFY CONNECT 2 PLUGIN

This new version is based  on [`librespot`](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot)
and the great addition from @ashthespy https://github.com/ashthespy for metadata integration in volumio!

It is still in dev and some features are missing.

![Alt text](volspotconnect2.jpg?raw=true "Spotify/volumio playing through volspotconnect2")

Tested on :
- RPI 0
- RPI B
- RPI B+
- RPI2
- SPARKY
- PINE64
- x86 laptop


## IMPORTANT

- Requires a Premium or Family account

## To install
Before intalling the dev version, REMOVE, if exists, the plugin from your system using the webUI plugins page.

Due to a [Volumio decision](https://volumio.org/forum/require-plugins-uploaded-plugins-repo-t8116-10.html), now third party or dev plugin can only be install through SSH. Here is how:

### 1. Enable SSH and connect to Volumio

For security reasons, SSH is disabled by default on all versions after 2.199 (except first boot). It can be however enabled very easily.

Navigate to the DEV ui by pointing your browser to http://VOLUMIOIP/DEV or http://volumio.local/DEV . Find the SSH section, and click enable. From now on your SSH will be permanently enabled.

Now you can connect to Volumio with username `volumio` and password `volumio`.

```
ssh volumio@volumio.local (if you changed the name of your device, replace the second volumio by it or use its IP address.
```

### 2. Download and install the plugin

Type the following commands to download and install plugin:

```
wget https://github.com/balbuze/volumio-plugins/raw/master/plugins/music_service/volspotconnect2/volspotconnect2.zip
mkdir ./volspotconnect2
miniunzip volspotconnect2.zip -d ./volspotconnect2
cd ./volspotconnect2
volumio plugin install
```
## Save setting of the plugin even if you change nothing to generate correct config file.


## Issues

Time is reset when changing volume in UI
UI may hangs sometimes when pressing buttons.
