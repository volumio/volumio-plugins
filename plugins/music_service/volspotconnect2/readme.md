#	VOLUMIO SPOTIFY CONNECT 2 PLUGIN

This new version is based librespot https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot
and the great addition from @ashthespy https://github.com/ashthespy for metadata integration in volumio!

It is still in dev and some feature are missing.


Tested on :
- RPI 0 
- RPI B
- RPI B+
- RPI2
- SPARKY
- PINE64
- x86 laptop

 
## IMPORTANT

- Requires a Premium or Family account

## To install

- You only need to download volspotconnect2.zip. Take care to download the "raw" file, not only html from github...
- From Volumio UI choose "plugins" in setting, then "upload plugin" and select the file you have downloaded
- Enable the plugin. That it !

## Issues

Time is reseted when changing volume in UI
Volumio UI restart the first time a track is played from spotify after a change in plugin setting
