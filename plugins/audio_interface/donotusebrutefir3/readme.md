##  Experimental version for modular_alsa - Do not use!!!

## DEPRECATED (but should work)
#	DSP for Volumio (previously Brutefir3)


This plugin is designed to apply FIR filter to your system. It uses [brutefir](https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~torger/brutefir.html) as convolution engine.

It provides :


- A automatic configuration - Just install and enable the plugin. It's ready for use !

- Hardware capabilities detection for output format and number of channels.

- The use of custom filters - for DRC digital room correction.

Supported :

    text- 32/64 bits floats line (.txt) in rephase
    S16_LE- 16 bits LPCM mono (.wav) in rePhase
    S24_LE- 24 bits LPCM mono (.wav) in rePhase
    S24_LE- 32 bits LPCM mono (.wav) in rePhase
    FLOAT_LE- 32 bits floating point (.pcm)
    FLOAT64_LE- 64 bits mono (.wav) from Acourate
    FLOAT64_LE- 64 bits IEEE-754 (.dbl) in rephase

- Specific attenuation for each pair of channels, with detection for the 2 first channels.

- The creation of filter from an impulse

# Special thanks

- Thanks a lot @krunok for your great help and suggestion to design this plugin. Your knowledge was more than helpful! ;-)

## NEW!

Now the plugin allows a fast and smooth swap between 2 set of filters.

you have to create 2 set of left and right filter according to the following naming convention:

for left XXXX_1.YYY and second filter XXXX_2.YYY

for right ZZZZ_1.YYY and second filter ZZZZ_2.YYY

filters must have the same attenuation, same type.

Then in the plugin,, select filter named with _1. Save, a new button appears to enable swapping!

New automatic clipping detection. Attenuation can be set automatcally. 

First experimental multi channel up to 2x4 !!! with hw detection capabilities of the DAC!

The plugin provide an exclusive feature we called __VoBAF__ : Volume Based Adaptativ Filtering ! Different filters may be applied depending on volume level. With that, it can apply filters such as adaptativ loudness.

- Place all VoBAF filters in the required VoBAFfilters shared directory. Up to 7 filters may be used. ( Low, LM1, LM2, LM3, M, HM, High )

- In webUI select first filter and enable VoBAF. Save, it's done!

- Now, when volume is changed, the plugin switches from a filter to an other smmothly!


The plugin is also able to auto generate filter in few clicks, just using a impluse from REW. To do that, it uses [DRC-FIR](http://drc-fir.sourceforge.net/). It gives very good results in few click!!!

 It will be documented soon!


To have a idea of what it is, have look here [brutefir plugin wiki](https://volumio.github.io/docs/Plugins_User_Manuals/brutefir/Drc_with_Volumio.html)




__Base scheme - signal path__

[volumio]--->[Loopback]--->[Brutefir]--->[output /DAC]


## INSTALLATION WARNING

First, you must have a working configuration with volumio, the dac you want to use and the mixer properly set.

# __ !!!! Does not work with RPI jack output !!!!__

## To install


Before intalling the dev version, __REMOVE__, if exists, the plugin from your system using the webUI plugins page and __REBOOT BEFORE INSTALLING__ a new version!

### 1. Enable SSH and connect to Volumio

To do that, have a look here : [ssh in volumio](https://volumio.github.io/docs/User_Manual/SSH.html)

### 2. Download and install the plugin

Type the following commands to download and install plugin:

```
wget https://github.com/balbuze/volumio-plugins/raw/alsa_modular/plugins/audio_interface/brutefir3/brutefir.zip
mkdir ./brutefir
miniunzip brutefir.zip -d ./brutefir
cd ./brutefir
volumio plugin install
cd ..
rm -Rf brutefir*
```

### 3. Using the plugin

In webUI, enable the plugin and wait about 20seconds.
A reboot is required for HW detection.

## What is working :

nearly everythings


## What is not working :

- ?
- Conf for the output is corrupted if something is saved in mixer settings...
