##  For Volumio3 => v 3.236


This plugin is designed to apply different type of Dsp on Volumio using [CamillaDsp](https://github.com/HEnquist/camilladsp)


Provides
- A 15 bands graphic equalizer
- Or a 2x15 bands graphic equalizer
- Or a Parametric equalizer with :
    - Up to 50 bands (peaking, lowshelf, highshelf, lowpass, highpass, notch, Linkwitz, ButterworthHighpass & ButterworthLowpass)
    - Equalizer scope for each band (L, R, L+R)
    - More than 3800 variant of headphones EQ from AutoEQ ! [AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq)
    - import for local EQ file (must be in /data/INTERNAL/FusionDsp/peq/)
- 5 custom preset
- Or a convolution filters (FIR) with autoswitch samplerate for filters
    - DRC-FIR to create filter with an impulse
- Access to CamillaDsp gui for advanced user

For all 
- Progressive Loudness effect with threshold setting - loudness curve based on ISO 226: 2003 standard
- Auto gain
- Toggle with/without effect
- Separate volume level for left an right
- 8 crossfeed for headphone (Bauer, Chu Moy, Jan Meier, Linkwitz, Natural 30deg, atural 50deg, SADIE D1, SADIE H15m)
- Mono / stereo toggle
- Channels input swap switch
- Delay with automatic calculation
- High quality resampling
- tools to easily plays test files (pink noise, sweep) to help measurments 

For PEQ equalizer, while importing file, you can add or replace values to EQ the setting.
- Select the file for left channel
- choose the scope L
- Choose the mode REPLACE
- Click Import
- choose the file for right channel
- choose the scope R
- chosse the mode ADD
- Click Import

Now EQ are loaded

Datas follow format below (max total 50 bands). Only PK (peaking) filters are imported. From REW, export 'filter settings as text' in Filter tasks tab.

```
Filter 4: ON PK Fc 48.05 Hz Gain -0.70 dB Q 23.967
Filter 5: ON PK Fc 53.10 Hz Gain -7.90 dB Q 3.340
Filter 6: ON PK Fc 57.20 Hz Gain -1.90 dB Q 10.194
Filter 7: ON PK Fc 60.00 Hz Gain -1.70 dB Q 13.930
Filter 8: ON PK Fc 62.30 Hz Gain -1.20 dB Q 22.931
Filter 9: ON PK Fc 133.5 Hz Gain -4.80 dB Q 4.247
Filter 10: ON PK Fc 178.5 Hz Gain 4.10 dB Q 2.002
Filter 11: ON PK Fc 249.0 Hz Gain -2.80 dB Q 8.261

```

For FIR, supported filters format

```
text- 32/64 bits floats line (.txt) in rephase
S16_LE- 16 bits LPCM mono (.wav) in rePhase
S24_LE- 24 bits LPCM mono (.wav) in rePhase
S24_LE- 32 bits LPCM mono (.wav) in rePhase
FLOAT_LE- 32 bits floating point (.pcm)
FLOAT64_LE- 64 bits IEEE-754 (.dbl) in rephase
```
