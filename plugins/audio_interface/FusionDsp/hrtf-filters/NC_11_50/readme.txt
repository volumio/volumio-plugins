Natural headphone crossfeed for Volumio based on "Natural headphone crossfeed foobar2000"
Original thread: https://www.head-fi.org/threads/natural-crossfeed-on-headphones-earphones-for-foobar2000-v2-1-major-update-made-public.811837/

Adopted to be used in Volumio FusionDSP by wbinek. No changes to the original hrtfs were made.

According to the files author:
V1.1 should be a subtle effect, sound should be slightly more forward and the left-centre-right blobs effect of headphone soundstage should be alleviated. At no point should the soundstage feel constricted in width. Indeed the soundstage should continue to be a very enveloping experience and you may at times struggle to identify whether the crossfeed is slotted in or out.
V2.0 should yield an obvious out-of-your-head effect similar to listening to a genuine stereo setup. I find that the illusion grows on me especially through extended listening and especially if you sit in front of your computer monitor (the sounds will appear to come from and around the monitor)

The author (Joseph Yeung) states that the HRTFs were modified to add the crossfeed between channels and modify phase part of the spectrum  accordingly. The amplitude part spectrum remains more or less unchainged (as the headphones should provide sufficient amplitude response). It makes them more suitable for headphone crossfeed than HRTFs from typical databases.
