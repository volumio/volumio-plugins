# This PCM is used to send the audio to BruteFIR.

# that BruteFIR can read the incoming audio from
# Loopback,1,5 (using the rate/format/channels as
# defined in volumioDsp)

# This PCM is used as the output by BruteFIR.
# It isn't technically necessary, but it makes
# it clear where the BruteFIR audio is supposed
# to go, and passes it back to Volumio.
# Note that this assumes that the BruteFIR
# output is using Linear samples (e.g. S16_LE,
# S24_LE, S32_LE etc). If not then a different
# plugin must be used to convert to linear, e.g.
# lfloat if the incoming audio is FLOAT format.
