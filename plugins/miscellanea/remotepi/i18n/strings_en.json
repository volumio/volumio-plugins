The plugin \"IR Remote Controller\" does this and also offers configurations for various remote controls. As powering on and off by IR remote control is handled by the RemotePi board directly a possibly existing key for the button used for powering down has to be removed from the lircd.conf files or a section referring to this button has to be removed from the lircrc files which are provided by the \"IR Remote Controller\" plugin.",
