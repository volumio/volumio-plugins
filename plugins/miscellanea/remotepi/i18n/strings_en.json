The plugin \"IR Remote Controller\" does this and also offers configurations for various remote controls. As powering on and off by IR remote control is handled by the RemotePi board directly KEY_POWER keys have to be removed from the lircd.conf files which are provided by the \"IR Remote Controller\" plugin.",
