#       Volumio Onkyo Control Plugin

(Hopefully) A simple plugin that is able to turn an Onkyo receiver on the network on and off when playback begins and ends using eISCP.

https://github.com/tillbaks/node-eiscp

## Features

- Automatically or manually detect compatible Onkyo receivers on the network .
- Send a power on or power off command to an Onkyo receiver when Volumio playback begins or ends.
- Set the volume on the receiver to a set value when Volumio playback begins.
- Delay the power off command to the receiver (to allow for pausing music without shutting down).
