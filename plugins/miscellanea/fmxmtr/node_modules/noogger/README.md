	consoleOutputLevel: 7, 
	
	fileOutput: true,
	fileOutputLevel: 7, 
	
	outputPath: "logs/",
	fileNameDateFormat: "DDMMYYYY",

	fileNamePrefix:"",
	fileNameSuffix:"",
	customIntro: null
```

## Parameters: 
-  	`consoleOutput` : `boolean` : Wether the logs should be printed on the console output as well, or not
-  	`consoleOutputLevel` : `int` or `string` or `array`  : Filters what is printed to the console with respect to log levels (specify the console output log level).
   	using int: from 0 to 7 
  	using string: any valid log level (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR,....)
  	using array: to allow to select multiple log levels without the constraint of order  eg: ['DEBUG','ERROR','WARNING']
-  	`fileOutput` : `boolean` : Wether the logs should be written to files or not
-  	`consoleOutputLevel` : `int` or `string` or `array`  : Filters what is written to log files with respect to log levels (works the same as consoleOutputLevel).
-  	`outputPath` : `string` : define the location where the log files  will be written
-  	`dateTimeFormat` : `string` : specifies the Date and time format to be used inside log file for each record.
                             refer to the date format section.
-  	`fileNameDateFormat`: `string` : the date format to be used in the log files name to differentiate them (per day); 
                               you can alter this, so that it will write one file per week or month or whatever you want,
                               refer to the date format section.
-  	`fileNamePrefix`: `string` : Prepends the given string to every log file name.
-  	`fileNameSuffix`: `string` : Appends the given string to every log file name.
-  	`customIntro`: `function` or `boolean` : Just. try it by stting it to true :) or supply your own function to be called when your application starts(at least at the point where you initialize noogger)


## Date and Time formatting

The formating is based on the moment.js library, since it is the one used.
